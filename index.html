    <header>Visual Code Studio and Console Screens </header>
    <p>To set up VS Code, make sure a folder is set up and create a file for html and if needed, css. From there start coding.</p>
    <p>The console screen is a useful tool in coding. It allows you to see where possible mistakes are and in what line of coding they are in. To open the console screen, right click in your creation and click inspect. After that, click console and it will show you the outputs of your codes. But, in order for that to work you have to type console.log(...) after the line of code.</p>
    <script>
var first_name="Ranbir ";
console.log(first_name);
var last_name="Kapoor";
console.log(last_name);
var full_name=first_name.concat(last_name);
console.log(full_name);
var a= 10;
var b= 5;
var add=a + b;
console.log(add);
